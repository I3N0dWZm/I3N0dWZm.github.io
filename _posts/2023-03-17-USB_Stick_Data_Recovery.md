A user came to me with a corrupted usb stick, most of the original files seemed to be intact but a lot of random large files had been generated, 
After spinning up a copy of kali linux I was able to view the data in an enclosed environment (and to make sure it wasnâ€™t windows malware!)

these files made it difficult to do anything with the USB stick as they had absorbed all the space.

Extract from terminal view of listing the usb stick.
